### MLOps Core Concepts

This document outlines the foundational concepts of MLOps, focusing on **Experiments** and **Models**, and their importance in machine learning workflows.

### 1. Experiments

An experiment groups together models aimed at solving a specific problem. Experiments involve the systematic process of developing and refining machine learning models to achieve specific outcomes.

#### Why Do We Need to Group?

- **Multiple Configurations**: Manage different model configurations such as hyperparameters, algorithms, and preprocessing techniques.
- **Version Control of Models and Data**: Track different versions of models and the data used in training them, ensuring reproducibility and the ability to roll back to previous versions.
- **Compare Different Models**: Easily compare various models built for a specific task to identify the best-performing one.
- **Deploy the Best Model in Production**: Streamline the process of selecting and deploying the optimal model to production.
- **Tagging**: Tag the best model under each experiment to facilitate traceability and reproducibility.

### 2. Models

Models in MLflow represent the key entity for managing machine learning models and their associated metadata.

#### Functions of Models

- **Model and Data Versioning**: Maintain versions of models and the data they were trained on, ensuring consistent and reproducible experiments.
- **Storing Artifacts**: Store model files and preprocessing artifacts, enabling easy retrieval and deployment of models along with their required preprocessing steps.
- **Tracking Metadata**: Capture metadata associated with models, such as hyperparameters, metrics, and the environment in which the model was trained.
- **Model Registry**: Provide a centralized repository for registering, organizing, and managing models, allowing for collaboration and versioning.
- **Model Deployment**: Facilitate model deployment by packaging models with their required dependencies and enabling seamless integration with deployment platforms.
